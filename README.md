# floppy-decode

## What is this?

This is a tool to, given a waveform from an oscilloscope connected to
the data line of a floppy drive, extract the data from the signal.

Specifically, given a CSV file generated by my Rigol 1052, break it
apart. Given I'm mostly trying to understand how the data is encoded,
this is a specialised, hacked-up tool to process the specific samples
I've collected, rather than a proper robust tool. Do not expect it to
work on a random waveform you provide without tweaking. There are
semi-arbitrary constants embedded in the source, and I'm specifically
trying to extract the boot sector from a 1.44MB 3.5" floppy.

## Where did I get my disk format spec from?

I used a combination of <a
href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YeALBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA95">this
book</a> and <a
href="http://jlgconsult.pagesperso-orange.fr/Atari/diskette/diskette_en.htm">this
page</a>. MFM is a really neat idea.

## Does it work?

Well, I've retrieved data with plausible-looking text in it!

## Haskell, really?

It's my favourite language for playing with things like this. I should
probably have used a parser combinator.

## Anything else...

Feel free to contact me for questions or comments. Cheers.
